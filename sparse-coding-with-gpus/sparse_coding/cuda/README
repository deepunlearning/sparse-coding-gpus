How to run:
====================================================
Edit Makefile and update CUDA_INC and CUDA_LIB to your machine's CUDA locations for the include and library files.

Run:
$ ./paper_demo.sh (short version)
or
$ ./paper.sh (longer version)

All directories and files, including 'natural' images required as inputs and temporary outputs are checked in, so if you've checked the source code out, should not have to change anything. 

For debugging purposes though: depends on ../../images directory. Also depends on a ./tmp directory existing.

====================================================
Description:
====================================================
Above trains our model on 'natural' images. We iteratively train for the 
coefficients (keeping the basis fixed) and the basis (keeping the coefficients)
fixed. Each of these steps exploits the GPU. The coefficients portion 
uses the parallelized coordinate descent algorithm and uses kernel CUDA code.
The basis computation portion uses CuBLAS libraries for matrix algebra.


====================================================
Description of arguments:
====================================================
n:  		number of basis vectors
k: 		is number of dimensions in each vector
mb: 		is the number of example patches per batch
nb: 		is the number of batches
nepoch:		number iterations to loop over all the batches 
eta: 		used in the projected gradient descent (controls descent step size)
nbasis_iters:	max iterations before exiting basis computation section
beta:		used in the objective function
runwhat:	'natural' (used for other experiments as well, but use this for paper)
basisdir:       output directory for storing basis that were computed

====================================================
Code details:
====================================================
main.cc: run_expt_together
 main function that runs the experiments on the natural images. 
 loops over the coefficient computation and the basis computation iteratively.

l1ls_coord_descent.cu: l1ls_coord_descent_cu_basic
 function that computes the coefficients using the parallelized l1-regularized 
least squares using coordinate descent. This uses kernel CUDA code.

proj_grad_descent.cu: proj_grad_descent_cu_basic
 function that computes the basis using fixed coefficients and uses CuBLAS.
